  # Projects
  
- #### Decision Tree
 Implement decision tree from scratch (with ID3 algorithm and Entropy & Gini functions) to classify schools due to their provided information. we used Nursary dataset.

- #### Baysian 
classifying the breast cancer images using GussianNB and plotting confusion matrix. 

- #### Artificial Neural Network
Estimating the cost hotel arrangement using NN and CIFAR10 datasetm, and try to enhance the network performance by testing different activaton functions.

- #### SVM 
Classification on Anuran dataset using soft margin and hard margin SVM.
